<h1>My Hobby</h1>
<h3>Basketball</h3>
  <img src="Basketball.jpg"width="20%">
  <p>I love to play <strong>basketball.</strong> I have started playing it since I was in middle school. At that moment, my friend taught me how to make a goal with lay-up shooting.
    <br>In first try, I made a goal, and I felt amazing. I can say that is a <strong><u>moment that I fall in love with basketball.</u></strong>
    <br>My favorite NBA team is <strong><u>OKC Thunder</u></strong>, Oklahoma City Thunder, I loved this team when KD and Westbrook were playing together.
    <br>After they left the team, I kinda miss to see them playing together. But, now, I just expect to see Shai growing in OKC to lead us to winning the Championship.</p>
