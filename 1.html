  <h3>June 25th</h3>
  <p>Yesterday was <strong>my <u>birthday</u></strong>.<br>It was great to get celebrated by my favorite people.<br> I had a great meal and had fun with my people. And today is <strong>june 25th</strong>.<br>I am at the cafe nearby my house, and learning how to use HTML by watching video on the site named, <u>"Coding Everybody"</u></p>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;"><h3>June.29th</h3>
  <p>It's rain a lot today. I went to Kkachisan with JJM and PSK, eating Spiced Chicken and it was pretty good.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;"><h3>June.30</h3>
  <p>It is the last day of june. I cannot believe I already spent half of 2020. It has been terrible year because of COVID-19, but since I'm having great time with my friends, it is pretty good.<br> I had the last English class today, think it was worth to finish it.<br> I have learned how to create server with 'GITHUB', it is pretty cool that I can actually run the server.</p>
